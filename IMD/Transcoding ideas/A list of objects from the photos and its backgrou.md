# A list of objects from the photos and its background story

Specifics: Description of the text illustrating the situation from the photo. Also a list of objects (ARRA, a table, on the table there are relays.... )  
Thoughts: - Very specific description of what kind of objects they are.
- How they are placed also (How far are they from each other? How the woman looking? How does she standing?)
- What kind of computer is it?
- Is it going to be printed? How is it going to be visibly displayed?
