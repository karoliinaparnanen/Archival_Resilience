A primary function of the archive involves securing the long-term preservation of artefacts and documents. But as contemporary cultural practices increasingly take place online (within and through immaterial digital formats), new strategies of resilience are needed to ensure long-term preservation and access of digital heritage. Challenges â€” such as technological obsolescence and linguistic evolutions â€” can be addressed through translation, transcoding and novel design approaches.

In collaboration with the IISG, students will research, design and develop long-term archival approaches for a single cultural commodity. This process requires both resilient hardware and software, new digital tools and analogue strategies for transcoding media. Students in IMD and Coding will learn about current strategies and methods for archiving digital culture at the IISG. During the assignment, they will select materials from the physical archive of the IISG and also explore the hardware and tools used for transcoding and digitizing various media at the institution. The aim of this collaboration is for students to devise novel processes with existing transcoding systems at the IISG, but also develop new tools and transcoding methods that can be of interest for the IISG in thinking about how they translate between physical and digital materials.

# **BRIEF**

Research, design and develop a *long-term archival solution* for a single physical, cultural commodity. Your approach will make use of both hardware and software, digital tools and analogue strategies. The emphasis of this assignment is on **transcoding**, and a single object or material will therefore be transcoded multiple times and through different strategies and tools developed in your research process.

## **Steps**

Select one artefact from the physical archives of the IISG archive (for example: a Poster or Pin or Object or Book) which you will be working with to ***transcode*** into a number of diverse media and formats. You can make use of the transcoding equipment of the IISG, but will also develop your own additional methods. This includes digital tools, created in coding, for performing your transcodings. 

During this project documentation of the research, process, artefact translations and transcoding tool(s) will be logged in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (a lightweight markup language). This document will function as a repository for all the work. Changes and developments will be tracked using GitHub. (Apps such as Notion & Dropbox Paper natively work with Markdown)

The Markdown documents of all students will be compiled into a large, collective manual on resilient archives, featuring the research, digital tools and transcoded cultural commodities developed during the semester. In building this collective set of alternative transcoding tools â€” and putting them in practice â€” the subject of resilience is central.

## Outcomes

A digital, screen-based ***Collection of Archival Resilience***, featuring:

- The Physical Artefacts from the IISG: transcoded into diverse media (multiple transcodings for each object)
- A repository of your transcoding tools (including documentation & instructions)

The outcomes (including both analog transcodings and the digital repository of tools) will be exhibited at the IISG. Students will also present or give a reading of their processes, transcoding tools and research.

**Your Markdown document is therefor your primary design format for all outcomes. You will submit one .md file, all media will be embedded or linked inside.**

# IMD CLASSES

### ðŸ—“ 27 January

**Topics:** Digital Durability; Transcoding; Initial Research

## THOUGHT EXERCISE:

How would you preserve a cultural artefact, if the IISG could no longer exist?
Think about:

â†’ **MEDIA** (Material)
Stone; Paper; Hard-drive; Network; etc

â†’ **FORMAT** (Encoding)
Original (physical;)  Facsimile (Photo; Print-out; JPG; MP3; MOV; etc)
Interpretative or Representative? 

â†’ **METHODOLOGY** (Transcoding)
What tools are required for transcoding the information?
What tools are needed for reading the information?
Language? Symbology? 

â†’ **PRESERVATION** (Lifespan)
What is the shelf-life of this transcoded media?

## INITIAL RESEARCH PRESENTATION â†’ 03 FEB

**Present one artefact from the IISG Archive found through your web search.**
Tell us **HOW** you found this artefact?
Tell us **ABOUT** this artefact: what current information is encoded in the IISG Archive, how, what formats?
Tell us something about the social history or context of the artefact. Something that isnâ€™t contained in the current IISG Record. 
How did you collect & store this research? Link; Download; In a Google Doc?
